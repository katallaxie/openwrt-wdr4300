Openwrt TP-Link WDR4300 Configuration
=====================================

* Openwrt: Barrier Breaker 14.07
* Packages: tba

This is my Openwrt configuration. It is in particular tuned for a Unitymedia Internet Access with DS-Lite.

You should login to your CISCO Modem at 192.168.0.1 (admin:atlanta) and disable all firewalls.
